  eulogyMethod: `
    <p class="mb-3">The Eulogy Method is one of the most powerful exercises for defining your North Star. It asks you to imagine yourself at the end of your life and think deeply about how you want to be remembered.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>How to approach this exercise:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Imagine your funeral. Who is there? What are they saying about you?</li>
      <li>Think beyond achievements. What kind of person were you? What values did you embody?</li>
      <li>Consider your relationships. Were you loving, supportive, present?</li>
      <li>Reflect on your impact. How did you make the world better?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Example prompts to consider:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>"They will remember me as someone who..."</li>
      <li>"The greatest gift I gave to others was..."</li>
      <li>"I lived a life characterized by..."</li>
      <li>"My legacy is..."</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3">This exercise helps you work backwards from the end to define what truly matters. It cuts through the noise of daily life and forces you to confront what you really value.</p>

    <p><em>Pro tip: Don't overthink it. Write what comes from your heart, not what sounds impressive.</em></p>
  `,

  bucketList: `
    <p class="mb-3">Your Bucket List is a collection of experiences you want to have in your lifetime. These are the adventures, moments, and milestones that would make you feel like you truly lived.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Places you want to visit, cultures to experience</li>
      <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Things you want to learn (languages, instruments, sports)</li>
      <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Connections you want to build or deepen</li>
      <li><strong>Achievements:</strong> Personal records, milestones, accomplishments</li>
      <li><strong>Experiences:</strong> Once-in-a-lifetime moments you want to create</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3">Think big, but also think specific. Instead of "travel more," write "Watch the sunrise at Angkor Wat" or "Hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu."</p>

    <p><em>Remember: Your bucket list should excite you. These are experiences worth living for.</em></p>
  `,

  missionPrompt: `
    <p class="mb-3">Your Mission is your "why" - the deeper purpose that drives you. It's the problem you want to solve, the change you want to create, or the impact you want to make in the world.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Questions to guide you:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>What problem in the world makes you angry or sad?</li>
      <li>If you had unlimited resources, what would you dedicate your life to?</li>
      <li>What injustice or inefficiency bothers you most?</li>
      <li>What unique perspective or experience do you have that could help others?</li>
      <li>What work would you do even if you never got paid or recognized?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Your mission doesn't have to be grandiose.</strong> It could be:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>"Help people find work they love"</li>
      <li>"Create beautiful spaces that bring people joy"</li>
      <li>"Support entrepreneurs in underserved communities"</li>
      <li>"Make healthy food accessible to everyone"</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Your mission gives your work meaning. It's the thread that connects everything you do.</em></p>
  `,

  successPrompt: `
    <p class="mb-3">Success is deeply personal. What looks like success to you might be completely different from what society tells you success should be.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Define success on YOUR terms:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Financial success: What does "enough" look like for you?</li>
      <li>Career success: What achievements would make you proud?</li>
      <li>Relationship success: What does a fulfilling social life look like?</li>
      <li>Health success: How do you want to feel in your body?</li>
      <li>Personal growth: What kind of person do you want to become?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Avoid these traps:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Defining success solely by external markers (titles, salary, possessions)</li>
      <li>Adopting someone else's definition of success</li>
      <li>Setting goals that don't align with your values</li>
      <li>Measuring success in only one dimension of life</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3">True success is living in alignment with your values and making progress toward your vision.</p>

    <p><em>Ask yourself: If I achieved this version of success, would I be genuinely happy?</em></p>

  threeYearDream: `
    <p class="mb-3">Your 3-Year Dream is a vivid, detailed picture of your life three years from now. It bridges the gap between your long-term Life Compass and your quarterly action plans.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Be specific about:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Daily life:</strong> What does a typical Tuesday look like?</li>

      <li><strong>Growth:</strong> What new skills or knowledge have you gained?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3">Write in present tense, as if you're already living this life. Use sensory details. Make it real enough that you can almost touch it.</p>

    <p><em>This isn't about predicting the future—it's about creating a compelling vision that pulls you forward.</em></p>

  odysseyPlan: `
    <p class="mb-3">The Odyssey Plan asks you to imagine three radically different five-year paths. This exercise reveals what you truly value and helps you make better decisions.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Your three paths:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Path 1:</strong> Your current trajectory. If you keep doing what you're doing, where will you be in 5 years?</li>
      <li><strong>Path 2:</strong> The alternative path. What would you do if your current path suddenly disappeared?</li>
      <li><strong>Path 3:</strong> The wild card. What would you do if money and judgment didn't matter?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>For each path, describe:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>What you'd be doing professionally</li>
      <li>Where you'd be living</li>
      <li>What your daily life looks like</li>
      <li>What excites you about this path</li>
      <li>What concerns you about this path</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>You might be surprised by what you discover. Sometimes Path 3 reveals your true desires.</em></p>

  futureCalendar: `
    <p class="mb-3">Your Future Calendar maps out the major milestones, events, and experiences you want to have over the next 3-5 years.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Career milestones:</strong> Launches, promotions, transitions</li>
      <li><strong>Personal events:</strong> Trips, celebrations, adventures</li>

      <li><strong>Health goals:</strong> Races, fitness milestones, wellness practices</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3">This isn't a rigid schedule—it's a flexible roadmap. You're painting a picture of what the next few years could include.</p>

    <p><em>Think of it as creating memories in advance. What future moments do you want to look back on?</em></p>

  // Quarterly Quests Guides
  quarterlyQuests: `
    <p class="mb-3">Quarterly Quests are your bridge between Vision and Action. The 90-day timeframe is the perfect "sweet spot"—long enough to accomplish something meaningful, short enough to maintain focus.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Quest Structure:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Main Quest:</strong> One BIG goal for Work and one for Life. These are your non-negotiables.</li>
      <li><strong>Side Quests:</strong> 2-3 supporting goals that enhance your Main Quest or round out your life.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Choosing great quests:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>They align with your Life Compass and 3-Year Dream</li>
      <li>They're specific and measurable ("Launch product" not "Work on product")</li>
      <li>They challenge you but are achievable in 90 days</li>
      <li>They excite and maybe slightly scare you</li>
      <li>Completing them would make you genuinely proud</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Work Main Quest: "Launch MVP and acquire 100 beta users"</li>
      <li>Life Main Quest: "Run a half marathon under 2 hours"</li>
      <li>Work Side Quest: "Complete advanced React course"</li>
      <li>Life Side Quest: "Read 12 books (1 per week)"</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Review your quests weekly. Adjust if needed. The goal is progress, not perfection.</em></p>

  battlefieldAssessment: `
    <p class="mb-3">The Battlefield Assessment is a strategic framework that helps you turn your quarterly quests into actionable plans. It follows a 3-step process: Quarter Assessment, Monthly Planning, and Weekly Execution.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>The 3-Step Framework:</strong></p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Step 1: Quarter Assessment (Đánh giá Chiến trường Quý)</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">At the beginning of each quarter, assess your battlefield:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Work:</strong> Analyze market trends, define OKRs, and formulate strategic plays</li>
      <li><strong>Life:</strong> Conduct personal SWOT, identify your fortress to conquer, and plan habits/projects</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Step 2: Monthly Planning (Triển khai Kế hoạch Tháng)</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">At the start of each month, review and adjust:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Check progress on your frontline</li>
      <li>Set sprint goals for the month</li>
      <li>Create a detailed action calendar</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Step 3: Weekly Execution (Tác chiến Hàng tuần)</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Every week, execute with precision:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Hold a weekly command huddle (review last week)</li>
      <li>Define your top 3 weekly missions</li>
      <li>Conduct a weekly debrief to learn and adjust</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>How to use this framework:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Click the chevron icon next to any quest to expand its assessment</li>
      <li>Fill out each step as you progress through the quarter</li>
      <li>Step 1 is completed once at the start of the quarter</li>
      <li>Step 2 is updated at the beginning of each month</li>
      <li>Step 3 is updated every week</li>
      <li>All data is automatically saved as you type</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>This framework transforms abstract goals into concrete action plans. Consistent execution is the key to winning your quests.</em></p>

  morningManifesto: `
    <p class="mb-3">The Morning Manifesto is a 5-minute ritual that sets the tone for your entire day. It primes your mind for intentionality and gratitude.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>The Three Questions:</strong></p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>1. How am I feeling?</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Check in with yourself. Acknowledge your emotional state without judgment. Awareness is the first step to intentional living.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>2. What am I grateful for?</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Gratitude rewires your brain for positivity. It can be simple: coffee, sunshine, a conversation, your health. Start your day appreciating what you have.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>3. What is my adventure today? (MIT - Most Important Thing)</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">If you could only accomplish ONE thing today, what would make you feel successful? This is your non-negotiable. Everything else is secondary.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Pro tips:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Do this before checking your phone or email</li>
      <li>Link your MIT to your weekly priorities or quarterly quests</li>
      <li>Make your MIT specific and achievable in one day</li>
      <li>Your MIT should ladder up to your bigger goals</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>This simple ritual creates momentum. Win the morning, win the day.</em></p>
  `,

  eveningShutdown: `
    <p class="mb-3">The Evening Shutdown is a 5-minute ritual that closes your workday with intention. It helps you celebrate progress, extract learning, and prepare for tomorrow.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>The Three Reflections:</strong></p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>1. What did I accomplish?</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Celebrate your wins, big and small. Did you finish your MIT? Make progress on a task? Have a good conversation? Acknowledge it. This builds momentum and confidence.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>2. What did I learn?</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Extract lessons from your day. What worked? What didn't? What would you do differently? Daily reflection compounds into wisdom.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>3. What's the plan for tomorrow?</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Do a quick brain dump. What needs to happen tomorrow? This gets it out of your head so you can rest. You'll wake up knowing exactly where to start.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Benefits of the shutdown:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Creates closure—signals to your brain that work is done</li>
      <li>Reduces anxiety about forgetting something</li>
      <li>Helps you transition to personal time</li>
      <li>Builds a library of lessons and progress over time</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>The shutdown ritual is a gift to your future self. You'll thank yourself in the morning.</em></p>

  // Weekly Plan Guides
  weeklyReview: `
    <p class="mb-3">The Weekly Review is a 15-minute ritual that keeps you on track with your quarterly quests. It's your opportunity to course-correct, celebrate progress, and plan ahead.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>The Review Process:</strong></p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>1. Wins & Accomplishments</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">What went well this week? What are you proud of? Celebrate progress, no matter how small. Positive reinforcement is powerful.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>2. Challenges & Lessons</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">What didn't go as planned? What got in the way? What did you learn? Obstacles are data—use them to improve.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>3. Top 3-5 Priorities for Next Week</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Based on your quarterly quests, what needs to happen next week? Be specific. These priorities should ladder up to your Main and Side Quests.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Making it effective:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Schedule it at the same time every week (Friday afternoon or Sunday evening works well)</li>
      <li>Review your quarterly quests first to maintain alignment</li>
      <li>Be honest about what's working and what's not</li>
      <li>Adjust your approach based on what you learn</li>
      <li>Use the Golden Thread to link weekly priorities to your daily MITs</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>The weekly review prevents you from drifting. It keeps your daily actions aligned with your bigger goals.</em></p>

  idealWeekCalendar: `
    <p class="mb-3">Your Ideal Week Calendar is a template for how you want to spend your time. It's not a rigid schedule—it's a design for a balanced, productive life.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>What to block out:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Deep Work Blocks:</strong> 3-5 Focus Hours for your most important work</li>
      <li><strong>Meeting Times:</strong> When you're available for collaboration</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Time:</strong> Exercise, meals, family, hobbies</li>
      <li><strong>Learning Time:</strong> Reading, courses, skill development</li>
      <li><strong>Buffer Time:</strong> Space for the unexpected</li>
      <li><strong>Recovery Time:</strong> Rest, leisure, recharge</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Design principles:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Schedule your most important work during your peak energy hours</li>
      <li>Batch similar tasks together (meetings, admin work, creative work)</li>
      <li>Protect time for deep work—treat it as sacred</li>
      <li>Include transition time between different types of work</li>
      <li>Balance work with rest—both are essential for peak performance</li>
      <li>Leave space for spontaneity and emergence</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Optional: Sync with Google Calendar</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">You can overlay your actual calendar events on your ideal week. This helps you see where reality diverges from your ideal and make adjustments.</p>

  // Focus Timer Guides
  focusHourFormula: `
    <p class="mb-3">The Focus Hour Formula is the atomic unit of deep work in LifeOS. It's built on the 5-50-5 structure: 5 minutes Planning, 50 minutes Focusing, 5 minutes Reflecting & Recharging.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Phase 1: PLAN & ORGANIZE (5 minutes)</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Plan:</strong> What exactly will you accomplish in the next 50 minutes? Be specific.</li>
      <li><strong>Organize:</strong> Clear your physical and digital workspace. Remove distractions.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare:</strong> Get everything you need within reach. Close unnecessary tabs and apps.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Phase 2: FOCUS (50 minutes)</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Work on ONLY your stated goal—nothing else</li>
      <li>Use the Capture System for distracting thoughts (write them down, deal with later)</li>
      <li>Track disruptors when they arise (procrastination, distraction, burnout, perfectionism)</li>
      <li>Use your Focus Toolkit when you need to activate or reactivate</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Phase 3: REFLECT & RECHARGE (5 minutes)</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Reflect:</strong> What worked? What distracted you? What can you improve?</li>
      <li><strong>Recharge:</strong> Step away from your workspace. Move your body. Rest your mind.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Why this structure works:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>Planning creates intention—you know exactly what success looks like</li>
      <li>50 minutes is long enough for deep work but short enough to maintain focus</li>
      <li>Reflection helps you improve over time—small adjustments compound</li>
      <li>Recharge prevents burnout and maintains sustainable productivity</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Consistency beats intensity. Better to do 2-3 solid Focus Hours daily than to burn out on a 12-hour grind.</em></p>
  `,

  focusToolkit: `
    <p class="mb-3">Your Focus Toolkit contains strategies to help you start and maintain deep work. There are two types: Activation (to get started) and Reactivation (to refocus when distracted).</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Activation Menu - Getting Started:</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Use these when you're procrastinating or struggling to begin:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Listen to favorite music:</strong> Prime your brain with energy and emotion</li>
      <li><strong>3-minute breathing:</strong> Calm your nervous system and create presence</li>
      <li><strong>Do a super easy admin task:</strong> Build momentum with a quick win</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Reactivation Menu - Refocusing:</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Use these when you've lost focus during your work session:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>60-second stretch/jump:</strong> Reset your body to reset your mind</li>
      <li><strong>Change music/scenery:</strong> Shift your environment to shift your state</li>
      <li><strong>Move phone to another room:</strong> Eliminate the source of distraction</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Customize your toolkit:</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">The default tools are a starting point. Add your own strategies that work for YOU. Examples:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li>"Read my quarterly quests"</li>
      <li>"Look at my vision board"</li>
      <li>"Drink a glass of water"</li>
      <li>"Do 10 pushups"</li>
      <li>"Review yesterday's wins"</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Track what works. Your Focus Toolkit should evolve based on real data about what helps YOU focus best.</em></p>
  `,

  focusDisruptors: `
    <p class="mb-3">Focus Disruptors are the enemies of deep work. By tracking them, you gain insight into your patterns and can build strategies to overcome them.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>The Four Disruptors:</strong></p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>1. Procrastination</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">You know what to do, but you're avoiding it. Often caused by fear, overwhelm, or lack of clarity.</p>
    <p class="mb-2"><em>Antidote:</em> Break the task into smaller steps. Use the 2-minute rule—just start for 2 minutes.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>2. Distraction</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">External interruptions or internal mind-wandering pulling you away from your work.</p>
    <p class="mb-2"><em>Antidote:</em> Eliminate sources (silence phone, close tabs). Use the Capture System for wandering thoughts.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>3. Burnout</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Mental or physical exhaustion making it hard to focus. You're pushing too hard without adequate recovery.</p>
    <p class="mb-2"><em>Antidote:</em> Take a break. Rest. Do something energizing. Sometimes the best productivity move is to stop working.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>4. Perfectionism</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-2">Getting stuck trying to make something perfect instead of moving forward. Progress > perfection.</p>
    <p class="mb-2"><em>Antidote:</em> Embrace "good enough." Set a timer. Ship it imperfect. You can always iterate.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">When you feel a disruptor arising during your Focus Hour, click to track it. Over time, you'll see patterns and can address root causes.</p>

    <p><em>Awareness is the first step to mastery. You can't fix what you don't measure.</em></p>
  `,

  rechargeMenu: `
    <p class="mb-3">The Recharge Menu contains activities to help you recover after a Focus Hour. Recovery isn't laziness—it's essential for sustained high performance.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Default Recharge Activities:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Take a 10-minute walk:</strong> Movement + nature = mental reset</li>
      <li><strong>Stretch or do light yoga:</strong> Release physical tension</li>
      <li><strong>Make a cup of tea/coffee:</strong> Ritualistic comfort + caffeine (if needed)</li>
      <li><strong>Listen to music:</strong> Emotional regulation and enjoyment</li>
      <li><strong>Step outside for fresh air:</strong> Change of environment + oxygen boost</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-3"><strong>What makes a good recharge activity:</strong></p>
